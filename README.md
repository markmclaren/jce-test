# jce-test
A quick test to see if you have the JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy files installed

Cribbed from https://gist.github.com/evaryont/6786915

which was inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11538746/check-for-jce-unlimited-strength-jurisdiction-policy-files

Repeated here because I wanted something I could checkout and run on a Jenkins server.

mvn compile exec:java
